Review
The submitted project closely aligns with the instructor's instructions which require managing AWS Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs) for network security. The documentation is detailed, systematic, and supported by screenshots. Here's the evaluation based on the given criteria:

Purpose:
The project aims to provide practical experience configuring Security Groups and NACLs to secure network traffic. The screenshots and step-by-step instructions clarify the setup process. The use of specific IPs (e.g., 50.18.32.11/32) to test and enforce rules demonstrates a focus on practical implementation. Score: 25/25

Requirement:
The requirements from the instructor, such as VPC setup, EC2 Security Groups, NACL configuration, rule testing, troubleshooting, and documentation, are fulfilled. The screenshots depict each step, including creating inbound/outbound rules and associating a custom NACL with a subnet. Moreover, the documentation explores issues like rule precedence (e.g., NACL's lowest rule number taking precedence). Score: 25/25

Use Case:
The project successfully addresses real-world use cases for network security in AWS environments, such as restricting SSH and HTTP access, layering security at the instance and subnet levels, and testing connectivity. The analogy comparing NACLs and Security Groups adds clarity and relevance to practical scenarios. Score: 25/25

Performance:
The project‚Äôs robustness is demonstrated in the thorough troubleshooting section and multiple scenarios clarifying the impact of rule conflicts and modifications. The testing screenshots are essential for documenting the rule configurations' effectiveness (e.g., verifying connectivity failures when rules are misconfigured). Score: 25/25

Strengths:
The guide is comprehensive and logically structured.
The screenshots improve clarity, making it easy to follow.
The troubleshooting section investigates connectivity issues effectively.
Areas for Improvement:
Explicit guidelines on best practices for defining critical thresholds.
Introduce detailed logging or monitoring tools for tracking rule changes, though this is minor as it wasn‚Äôt specified in the instructions.
Overall, the submission effectively meets and exceeds the instructor's expectations.
